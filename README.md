# JordanKirby-Portfolio

This site holds the key infomation about Jordan Kirby. Inside you will find a landing page with a picture of me along with some infomation. In the upper right of the screen you will find links to the page on how to contact me and a small sample size of my work.

## What I Learned

At first I had a hard time visualizing a grid layout for all the contents until I added a visual guide on the top of the screen. I also made a nested grid guild.
